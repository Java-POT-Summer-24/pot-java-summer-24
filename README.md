### Manual to run different profiles in the project:
#### Development mode profile - the application uses an H2 in-memory database.
Run the following commands:
1. "gradle build" in Git bash
2. "docker-compose --profile dev up" in cmd

This command will:

Build the application Docker image.

Start the application with the development profile.

Map port 8081 on your host to port 8080 in the container to avoid port conflicts.

Access the application on http://localhost:8081

#### Production mode profile - the application uses a PostgreSQL database.
Run the following commands:
1. "gradle build" in Git bash
2. "docker-compose --profile prod up" in cmd

This command will:

Build the application Docker image.

Start the PostgreSQL database service.

Start the application with the production profile.

Map port 8080 on your host to port 8080 in the container.

Access the application on http://localhost:8080

#### To stop the application and remove the containers:
Run the following command:
"docker-compose down"
